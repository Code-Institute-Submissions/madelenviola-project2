## Design
### The look and feel of the website.
The goal of the design was for it to be simple, soft and serene. The design is a combination of muted but contrasting colors with two cloud illustration elements as background and footer. 
- The to-do list is displayed in a light yellow box that grows as the to-do list expands with each user input added to-do.
- The button to add task is purple pill button with CTA "add task". 
- The list items added to the to-do list features a checkbox to the left and input task text to the right.
- A purple trash can icon from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/trash-can?s=solid&f=classic) displays to the right of each task that the user inputs. When clicked the task is removed from the to-do list.
